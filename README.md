# Super Trapper 
Python program that will help us cop the best heat using PhantomJS and Selenium:

PhantomJS: brew install phantomjs

Selenium: pip install selenium

will add more documentation later.


Note: This will run off terminal after you add the two lines

```
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/.python"
ln -s /home/user/work/project/foo ~/.python/
```

This will make it so python is recognized as a module

running python main.py will now work from terminal
